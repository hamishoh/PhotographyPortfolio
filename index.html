        <p class="aboutme">Hi, my name is Hamish. I am 17 years old and am a Junior in high school. I love to ski, bike, and do everything that I can outdoors. Most of my photography revolves around sports or just photos of nature and animals.  I have only been photographing since the start of October in 2023 so I do not have a ton of photos yet but am taking them as often as I can. Thank you very much for coming to my website and looking at my photos!</p>
